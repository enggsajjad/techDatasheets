ABSTRACT for MemWrite
=====================
This program is a simple demonstration of the DATA, IDATA, PDATA, and XDATA
memory areas of the 8051.  The program writes a short string into each of
these memory areas.  You may use the memory window (View - Memory Window)
to view the contents of each memory area.

There are four user-configurable Memory Windows available.  Each one can be
configured to display a memory area and data type.  So, you can watch HEX
values from XDATA in one memory window and ASCII values from IDATA in another
window.

The example program writes stuff into memory ONLY for demonstration purposes.
You should not use this method of writing into memory in structured, high-level
programming languages.
